          Richard "Rick" Sanchez of Dimension C-137, commonly referred to as
          Rick C-137, is one of the two titular protagonists of Rick and Morty,
          alongside Morty. He is a megagenius[6] scientist whose alcoholism and
          reckless, nihilistic behavior are sources of concern for his
          "daughter's" family, as well as the safety of their son, Morty. Upon
          the series' inception, Rick's mysterious origins and mental health
          were large sources of speculation.

        <p>
          Mortimer Chauncey "Morty" Smith Sr. of the Prime Universe/Cronenberged
          Dimension is one of the two titular protagonists of Rick and Morty,
          alongside Rick. He was often incorrectly identified as Morty C-137
          until Season 5. Morty is Rick Sanchez's grandson and was often forced
          to tag along on his various misadventures as a sidekick whilst
          attending Harry Herpson High School along with his sister, Summer.[8]
          At the beginning of the series, Morty was shown to be an incredibly
          anxious and submissive teenage boy. He had little say in the
          adventures he went on with Rick and was often verbally abused and
          manipulated by him. However, Morty eventually gained more confidence
          as time went on and is now more capable and independent rather than a
          mere sidekick. This newfound confidence also allowed Morty to distance
          himself from Rick more often due to his despicable tendencies,
          although Morty still stays by his side when necessary.

        <h1>Jerry Smith</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Jerry Smith of Dimension 5126 is one of the five main characters in
          Rick and Morty. Jerry is the husband of Beth Smith, the father of
          Summer Smith and Morty Smith, and the son-in-law of Rick Sanchez. The
          first six episodes of Season 1 featured Jerry Smith Prime, while
          subsequent episodes featured a Jerry who was born in and inhabited
          Dimension C-131 up until episode 2 of season 2 where he switched
          places with this Jerry at the Jerryboree. Jerry is often noted as
          somewhat of a loser. He constantly attempts to find a career to no
          avail, leaving his wife Beth to be the breadwinner of the family.
          However, he is capable of heroism in times of crisis and has saved his
          family's lives on a few occasions. Jerry's marriage to Beth is often
          rocky and unstable, resulting in the two finally getting a divorce in
          the Season 3 premiere. Jerry would spend most of the season living
          alone and depressed in a small apartment, until he and Beth reconcile
          in the Season 3 finale, although it's currently unknown if the Beth he
          re-married is a clone or the original Beth.
